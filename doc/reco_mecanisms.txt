Glosses are files containing one signbox in fsw per lign, for example:
"M518x589S22a15494x524S20e00477x520S14c18489x543S30003482x483S20f00460x549S1f548459x511S2b213450x566
AS15d41S15d0aS20700S26f03M524x536S15d0a475x517S15d41501x496S20700484x509S26f03493x463
M531x559S34000482x483S30a00482x483S20320496x533S27106516x519"
